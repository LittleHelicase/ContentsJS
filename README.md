ContentsJS
==========

Non-Linear System for Content presentation

Running Examples
================

The Web-Example isn't working yet. To start the terminal example call
```
lsc examples/terminal/blessed-terminal.ls ../examples/documentation
```
from the base directory, where lsc is the livescript interpreter. The contents directory (first parameter for blessed-terminal.ls is still relative to the contents.ls file).
